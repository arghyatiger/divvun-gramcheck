#+TITLE: Example of using divvun-gramcheck as lib
#+STARTUP: showall

* Description

This is an example of using divvun-gramcheck's =libdivvun= from a C++
project, basically reimplementing the =divvun-checker= binary of
divvun-gramcheck.

The purpose of this example is just to make it easy for others to use
the library, and to check that it's possible to use the installed
library without access to the divvun-gramcheck source.

First, compile divvun-gramcheck with =./configure --enable-checker=
and =sudo make install=, then from this directory you should be able to

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
#+END_SRC

and run e.g. =src/using-checker -s /path/to/pipespec.xml -n pipename=.
