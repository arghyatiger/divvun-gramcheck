This should:

- [ ] read cg format
- [ ] load errors.xml
- [X] load an hfstol bin
- [ ] generate forms from CG-specified analyses
- [ ] possibly load some additional specification for how to extract forms from CG-format?

See voikko/src/morphology/HfstAnalyzer.cpp â€“ uses ospell.h, can we use that?
