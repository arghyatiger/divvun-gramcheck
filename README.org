This should:

- [X] read cg format
- [ ] load errors.xml
- [X] load an hfstol bin
- [X] generate forms from CG-specified analyses
- [ ] only generate forms if analyses have a certain tag (and don't send that tag to generator)
- [ ] possibly load some additional specification for how to extract forms from CG-format?

Also TODO:
- [ ] better way to skip @FLAGDIACRITICS@ in output
- [ ] deal with subreadings
