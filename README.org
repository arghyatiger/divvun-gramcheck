* Description

This program does FST lookup on forms specified as Constraint
Grammar format readings, and looks up error-tags in an XML file with
human-readable messages. It is meant to be used as a late stage of a
grammar checker pipeline.

The main output format is JSON, although it can also simply annotate
readings in CG stream format.

* Prerequisites

- gcc >=5.0.0 with libstdc++-5-dev (or similarly recent version of
  clang, with full C++11 support)
- libpugixml >=1.7.2
- libhfst >=3.9.0

Tested with gcc-5.2.0, gcc-5.3.1 and clang-703.0.29. On Mac OS X, the
newest XCode includes a modern C++ compiler.

If you can't easily install libpugixml, you can run
[[file:scripts/get-pugixml-and-build][scripts/get-pugixml-and-build]] which will download libpugixml into this
directory, build that (with cmake) and configure this program to use
that library. Alternatively, you can run ./configure with
--disable-xml if you don't care about human-readable error messages.

* Building

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./autogen.sh
./configure  # optionally with argument --prefix=$HOME/my/prefix
make
make install # with sudo if you didn't specify a prefix
#+END_SRC


On OS X, you may have to do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo port install pugixml
export CC=clang CXX=clang++ "CXXFLAGS=-std=gnu++11 -stdlib=libc++"
./autogen.sh
./configure  LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib # optionally with argument --prefix=$HOME/my/prefix
make
make install # with sudo if you didn't specify a prefix
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Takes two arguments: a generator FST (in HFST optimised lookup
format), and an error message XML file (see [[https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/langs/sme/tools/grammarcheckers/errors.xml][the one for Northern Saami]]
for an example), with input/output as stdin and stdout:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
src/divvun-suggest --json generator-gt-norm.hfstol errors.xml < input > output
#+END_SRC


More typically, it'll be in a pipeline after various runs of =vislcg3=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo words go here | hfst-tokenise -wacku: tokeniser.pmhfst | â€¦ | vislcg3 â€¦ \
  | divvun-suggest --json generator-gt-norm.hfstol errors.xml
#+END_SRC

* JSON format
The JSON output is meant to be sent to a client such as
https://github.com/unhammer/divvun-webdemo. The current format is:

: {errs:[[str:string, beg:number, end:number, typ:string, exp:string, [rep:string]]], text:string}

The string =text= is the input, for sanity-checking.

The array-of-arrays =errs= has one array per error. Within each
error-array, =beg/end= are offsets in =text=, =typ= is the (internal)
error type, =exp= is the human-readable explanation, and each =rep= is
a possible suggestion for replacement of the text between =beg/end= in
=text=.

The index =beg= is inclusive, =end= exclusive, and both indices are
based on a UTF-16 encoding (which is what JavaScript uses, so e.g. the
emoji "ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´" will increase the index of the following errors by 4).

Example output:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  {
    "errs": [
      [
        "badjel",
        37,
        43,
        "lex-bokte-not-badjel",
        "\"bokte\" iige \"badjel\"",
        [
          "bokte"
        ]
      ]
    ],
    "text": "ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´sÃ¡ddejuvvot bÃ¡hpirat interneahta badjel.\n"
  }
#+END_SRC

* Troubleshooting

If you get
: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::regex_error'
:   what():  regex_error
or
: util.hpp:36:19: fatal error: codecvt: No such file or directory
:  #include <codecvt>
:                    ^
: compilation terminated.
then your C++ compiler is too old. See [[./README.org::*Prerequisites][Prerequisites]].


* Progress [12/16]

This should:

- [X] read cg format
- [X] load errors.xml
- [X] load an hfstol bin
- [X] generate forms from CG-specified analyses
- [X] only generate forms if analyses have a certain tag (and don't send that tag to generator)
- [ ] possibly load some additional specification for how to extract forms from CG-format?
- [X] optionally output as JSON
- [X] handle superblanks
- [X] 4+-byte UTF-8 input
- [X] default/fallback values for ids and regexes of ids in errors.xml

Also TODO:

- [X] <STREAMCMD:FLUSH>
- [ ] better way to skip @FLAGDIACRITICS@ in generator [[file:src/suggest.cpp::if(symbol.size()>0%20&&%20symbol%5B0%5D!='@')%20{][output]]
- [ ] deal with subreadings
- [X] input format needs to show where we have (and don't have) blanks
- [X] deal with the new blank format given by hfst-tokenise (and
  remove old blank hacks)
- [ ] handle &DELETE nicely (UI also: sihko sÃ¡ni = slett ordet)
